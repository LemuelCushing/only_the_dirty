## What's dirty? 

That little dot next the tab name - means you've got unsaved changes. Them's the dirty ones, we keep em. The clean tabs go home.

## Usage

Run "Close All Non-Dirty Tabs" from the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`).

## Settings

- `onlyTheDirty.keepPinnedTabs` (default: false): Keep pinned (non-preview) tabs open when closing non-dirty tabs.
