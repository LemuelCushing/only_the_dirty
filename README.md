# Only the Dirty

Close all non-dirty editor tabs, leaving only unsaved changes open.

## Usage

Run "Close All Non-Dirty Tabs" from the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`).

## What "dirty" means

In VS Code, a tab is "dirty" when you have unsaved changes to the file. Dirty tabs display a dot or indicator next to their name in the tab list. This command closes all tabs without unsaved changes, preserving your work-in-progress files.
